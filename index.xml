      <description>Introduction Recently I have been hearing about observability more and more.

      <description>Thank you very much for reading my blog.
My name is MD Sayem Ahmed. I am a Software Engineer by profession and currently living and working in Berlin, Germany.
I love working with complex distributed systems and building high-performance web applications. I am most experienced in Java-based technologies like Spring, JPA, Servlets, JSP, and related technologies, but I don&amp;rsquo;t mind working with other languages and tools if needed.
Here is a short list of my online profiles where you can find more information about me and my work -</description>
